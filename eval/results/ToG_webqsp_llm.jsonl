After World War I, the British took control of the area, and in 1917, they issued the Balfour Declaration, which expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. This led to an influx of Jewish immigrants, which caused tensions with the Arab population, who had been living in the area for centuries.\n\nIn 1948, the State of Israel was established, leading to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, known as the Nakba or \"catastrophe\" in Arabic, and the start of a long and complex conflict that continues to this day. The conflict has resulted in numerous wars, including the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the 1967 Six-Day War, and the 1973 Yom Kippur War, as well as numerous smaller-scale confrontations and acts of violence.", "reasoning_chains": []}
