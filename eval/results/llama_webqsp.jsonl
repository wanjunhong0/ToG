{"question": "what drug killed marilyn monroe?", "result": "  Marilyn Monroe's death on August 5, 1962, was ruled a probable suicide by the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. The coroner's report stated that her death was caused by acute barbiturate poisoning, with the presence of several drugs in her system, including Seconal (secobarbital) and Nembutal (pentobarbital).\n\nSeconal, a barbiturate sedative, was a prescription medication that Monroe had been taking for sleep and anxiety. Nembutal, also a barbiturate sedative, was not prescribed to Monroe, but it was found in her system at the time of her death.\n\nIt's worth noting that the circumstances of Monroe's death have been the subject of much speculation and debate over the years, with some theories suggesting that her death may have been an accidental overdose or even murder.

For example, humans are classified as Homo sapiens, with Homo being the genus and sapiens being the species. This system allows scientists to identify and communicate about different species in a precise and consistent manner.\n\nIn addition to"}

The Law of Segregation: Each pair of alleles (different forms of a gene) separates from each other during gamete formation, resulting in each gamete receiving one allele.\n2. The Law of Independent Assortment: Alleles for different traits are sorted independently of each other during gamete formation, resulting in a random combination of alleles.\n3.

Some of his most notable contributions include:\n\n1. Laws of Motion: Newton developed three laws of motion that describe how objects move and respond to forces. The first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. The second law describes the relationship between an object's mass and its acceleration, and the third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n2. Law of Universal Gravitation: Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This law explains the motion of planets around the sun and the falling of objects on Earth.\n3. Calculus: Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed calculus, a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and slopes of curves.

He observed that when gases are mixed together, they behave as if they are made up of tiny particles that are in constant motion, and that the pressure and volume of a gas are determined by the number of particles present, rather than by the size or weight of the particles.\n\nDalton used this observation to develop his atomic theory, which was presented in his book \"A New System of Chemical Philosophy\" in 1808. In this book, he proposed that elements are composed of small, indivisible particles called atoms, and that compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in whole number ratios.

In 1913, Bohr proposed a model of the atom that described the energy levels of electrons within an atom. This model, known as the Bohr model, posits that electrons exist in specific energy levels, or shells, around the nucleus of an atom.\n\nAccording to the Bohr model, the electrons in the outermost shell are called valence electrons, and they are responsible for the chemical properties of an element. The number of valence electrons an atom has determines its chemical properties and its position in the periodic table.\n\nBohr's model also introduced the concept of energy quantization, which states that the energy of an electron is not continuous, but rather comes in discrete packets, or quanta. This idea challenged the classical view of energy, which held that energy could take on any value.\n\nIn addition, Bohr's model explained the emission and absorption spectra of atoms, which are the patterns of light that atoms emit or absorb when they gain or lose energy.
